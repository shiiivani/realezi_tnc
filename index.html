                        <li>The Company shall not be responsible for any cancellation arising out of incomplete/invalid
                            documents in support of the booking and at the same time the Company owes no responsibility

                            financial institution.</li>
                        <li>The non-receipt of an email communication cannot be treated as a valid ground for
                            non-performance of any obligation or ignorance about a particular policy and/or other
                            aspects that may be contained in the email.</li>
                        <li>In case of any dispute the courts at Vadodara shall have the exclusive jurisdiction to try
                            and entertain the same. During the use of the website if any dispute arises out of such use
                            it will be subject to the laws of India and to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in
                            Vadodara.</li>
                        <li>Under the Lead Mapping System, the Client acknowledges having personally visited each
                            property/site accompanied by a Realezi team member. The Client confirms having no prior
                            knowledge or experience with the property/site prior to the site visit facilitated by
                            Realezi. The Client agrees that any subsequent transaction, whether intentional or
                            inadvertent, with the seller/builder, without involving Realezi, constitutes a breach of
                            this agreement. In the event of such a breach, the Client shall indemnify and hold Realezi
                            harmless from any and all claims, damages, or losses arising therefrom. The Client further
                            agrees to cooperate fully with Realezi in any legal proceedings involving the seller/builder
                            and to provide any necessary documentation or testimony.</li>
